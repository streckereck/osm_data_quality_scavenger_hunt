Quick tour of the HOT Tasking Manager (30 mins).

Presented to the CHATR Lab Feb 27, 2024.

## Goals

- Provide insight into OSM data generation data structures by editing.
- Introduce the HOT Tasking Manager by editing transportation data in rural Kenya.
- Can we use this tool to task OSM bike data collection?


## OpenStreetMap

![OpenStreetmap](www/Openstreetmap_logo.svg.png)

- "The volunteered street map of the world" and "the wikipedia of maps".
- Licensing, data structure, and availability of data facilitate a wide range of 
uses.
   - Tri Cities Fix.
   - OSM CanBICS.
- Open ended, flexible, extensive.

## VGI generation

- Editing is a great way to understand OSM.
- Key value pairs documented on the [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
- E.g., [highway = cycleway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcycleway).

#### ***Exercise 1.*** 
> On [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org), zoom into a feature, right click, click **query features** to view the tags. Leave it open!

## "Volunteered..."

- Editing takes time and effort.
- [The rise of corporate editors](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/232).
- [Involuntary geographic information](https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2011.595657), [fauxtomation](https://logicmag.io/failure/the-automation-charade/), 
and [hidden labour](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/hidden-work-created-artificial-intelligence-programs).

#### ***Exercise 2.*** 

> What is the editing history of the feature?

## HOT Tasking Manager

- how to coordinate large scale missions on a topic?
- Introducing the HOT Tasking manager!!
- [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/).

#### ***Exercise 3.***

> Go to the [HOT Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/) and login. Go to 
explore projects and search for **transportation**. Click on [**A Participatory GIS Toolkit for Transportation Needs Assessments in Rural Areas**.](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/12614) Read the description, questions and comments, and click on **Contribute**.

## Where to map?


#### ***Exersize 4.***

> Read the instructions. Pick a tile to map. Click on it, and then click **Map selected task**.

**Tips.** 

- If you pick a tile beside a completed tile, you can scroll over to take a look.
- Pick a small tile, or consider splitting into manageable pieces.

## Mapping

- Split into manageable pieces.
- Refer to the instructions.
- Use **Select another task to bail out!**
- Commit your changes.
- Use **completion** when done.

## Reflections

- How did it go?
