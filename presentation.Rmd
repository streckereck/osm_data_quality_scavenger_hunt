## Goals

- Provide insight into OSM data generation data structures by editing
- Introduce the HOT Tasking Manager by editing transportation data in Africa


## OpenStreetMap

<div class="columns-2">
![OpenStreetmap](www/Openstreetmap_logo.svg.png)

- "The volunteered street map of the world" and "the wikipedia of maps"
- Licensing, data structure, and availability of data facilitate a wide range of 
uses.
   - Tri Cities Fix
   - OSM CanBICS
- Open ended, flexible, extensive.

## VGI generation

- Doing some editing is a great way to understand OSM.
- Key value pairs documented on the [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
- E.g., [highway = cycleway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcycleway)

### Exercise 1. 
> On [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org), zoom into a feature, right click, click **query features** to view the tags. Leave it open!

## volunteered...

- Editing takes time and effort
- [The rise of corporate editors](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/232)
- [Involuntary geographic information](https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2011.595657), [fauxtomation](https://logicmag.io/failure/the-automation-charade/), 
and [hidden labour](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/hidden-work-created-artificial-intelligence-programs).

### Exercise 2. 

> What is the editing history of the feature?

## HOT Tasking Manager

- last time we demo'd the iD Editor - edit OSM within a web browser
- how to coordinate large scale missions on a topic?
- Introducing the HOT Tasking manager!!

- Exercise 3. Go to the HOT Tasking manager. Login. Explore projects. Search for transportation.
