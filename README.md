# OpenStreetMap Data Quality Scavenger Hunt
Presented to the CHATR Lab Feb 27, 2024.

## Goals

- Provide insight into OSM data generation and data structures.
- Critical look at data quality in our neighbourhoods.


## OpenStreetMap

![OpenStreetmap](www/Openstreetmap_logo.svg.png)

- "The volunteered street map of the world" and "the wikipedia of maps".
- Licensing, data structure, and availability of data facilitate a wide range of 
uses.
   - Tri Cities Fix.
   - OSM CanBICS.
- Open ended, flexible, extensive.

## VGI generation

- Editing is a great way to understand OSM.
- Key value pairs documented on the [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/).
- E.g., [highway = cycleway](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcycleway).

#### ***Exercise 1.*** 
> On [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org), zoom into a feature, right click, click **query features** to view the tags. Leave it open!

## "Volunteered..."

- Editing takes time and effort.
- [The rise of corporate editors](https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/8/5/232).
- [Involuntary geographic information](https://doi.org/10.1080/00045608.2011.595657), [fauxtomation](https://logicmag.io/failure/the-automation-charade/), 
and [hidden labour](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/hidden-work-created-artificial-intelligence-programs).

#### ***Exercise 2.*** 

> What is the editing history of the feature?

## OSM data quality scavenger hunt. 

- Choose on an area that you know - you will focus on that area.
- Think of recent changes:
  - Transportation infrastructure (walking or biking infrastructure!)
  - Buildings (new construction?)
  - Amenities (new/old businesses)

## Scavenger hunt - iD Editor

- Does the map reflect the recent change?
  - If yes, who added it? What other edits have they made? Why do you think they did this?
  - If not, can you add it? (no worries if too complicated!)
- Can you find a corporate editor?
  - Why are they doing this?
- What are the hot topics in your area of interest?

## Ohsome dashboard

- Intrinsic indicators of data quality
  - Count of edits
  - Count of editors
- Garden metaphor of OSM editing

## Scavenger hunt - Ohsome
- Go to the [ohSome Dashboard](https://dashboard.ohsome.org)
- Create a timeline of the count, length, or area of the feature you are interested in.
- Is your feature type being maintained?
- When was it added?
- Zooming out a bit, do you see an area where you are concerned about completeness?
